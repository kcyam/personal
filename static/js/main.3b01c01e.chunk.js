Looking at my food, I was worried that my food would be cold since we were positive that our food was just sitting in a heater waiting for us. I opened my bag and I looked at my sandwich. The chicken was alarmingly huge. I don\u2019t eat a lot of fast food, so I usually see McDonald\u2019s or Wendy\u2019s flat chicken patty. Popeye\u2019s had a slab of meat in a bun covered in sauce. The sandwich was still warm, and I am not picky when it comes to the temperature of my food. Only if it were cold or frozen, I would say something."),r.a.createElement("p",null,"The sandwich was really nice even given the fact that the chicken sitting under a heater. While the skin wasn\u2019t crispy, it still had some texture and the meat wasn\u2019t dry. The sauce was pleasantly spicy and kicked almost immediately. The pickles were okay. They weren\u2019t crunchy, and it did have a bit of tang, but it was almost completely drowned out by the sauce. I remember a few months ago when the hype of the new sandwich caused many stores to close in hours, and I look down and wonder again if my taste buds were too unrefined to appreciate the taste. True, my sandwich was not fresh, but even if it were, I probably would feel the exact same about the sandwich."),r.a.createElement("p",null,"I tried the fries after. They looked rather pale. (I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t take pictures of them, or of any of the food. I\u2019m trying to gain confidence to take pictures of my food before eating.) Thankfully, they tasted way better than they looked. Seasoned, spiced fries that were somehow crispy even when lukewarm. Willy asked for their \u201cBlackened Ranch Sauce\u201d and gave me them, so I dipped my fries into them. They tasted even better: even more heat with the usual ranch zest that I like."),r.a.createElement("p",null,"After we finished, we drove to a Wal-Mart to pick up items, and at that time, I felt slow and groggy. It was a sensation stronger than finishing a Munchie Meal. I felt my stomach gurgle and my head went foggy. I understood at that point and when I went back home, I went to sleep."),r.a.createElement("p",null,"I do like Popeyes, and even with a pre-made meal, it was still pretty good. I don\u2019t feel like coming back anytime soon, but I would not feel forced to come back immediately\u2026 or even later this month. In the meantime, I\u2019ll still be in my house job searching. I\u2019ll also promise to add pictures to my blog in later posts."))),r.a.createElement(i.Cell,{col:4},r.a.createElement("div",{className:"sidebar"},r.a.createElement("h1",null,"Archive"),r.a.createElement("a",{href:"https://kcyam.github.io/personal/#/food/1",rel:"noopener noreferrer",target:"_blank"},"First Impression: In-N-Out (Reflection)"),r.a.createElement("a",{href:"https://kcyam.github.io/personal/#/food/2",rel:"noopener noreferrer",target:"_blank"},"My First Time At Popeyes")))))}}]),t}(n.Component),A=function(){return r.a.createElement(s.a,null,r.a.createElement(c.c,null,r.a.createElement(c.a,{exact:!0,path:"/",component:g}),r.a.createElement(c.a,{exact:!0,path:"/aboutme",component:y}),r.a.createElement(c.a,{exact:!0,path:"/food",component:f}),r.a.createElement(c.a,{exact:!0,path:"/projects",component:j}),r.a.createElement(c.a,{exact:!0,path:"/osucompare",component:x}),r.a.createElement(c.a,{exact:!0,path:"/food/1",component:T}),r.a.createElement(c.a,{exact:!0,path:"/food/2",component:_})))};var S=function(){return r.a.createElement("div",{className:"Landing",style:{height:"100vh",margin:"auto",position:"relative",flex:0}},r.a.createElement(i.Layout,{fixedHeader:!0},r.a.createElement(i.Header,{title:"Kenneth Yam"},r.a.createElement(s.a,null,r.a.createElement("div",null,r.a.createElement(s.b,{to:"/",className:"header-text"},"Homepage"),r.a.createElement(s.b,{to:"/aboutme",className:"header-text"},"About Me"),r.a.createElement(s.b,{to:"/projects",className:"header-text"},"Projects"),r.a.createElement(s.b,{to:"/food",className:"header-text"},"Foods")))),r.a.createElement(i.Content,null,r.a.createElement("div",{className:"page-content"}),r.a.createElement(A,null))))};Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));a(109),a(110);l.a.render(r.a.createElement(s.a,null,r.a.createElement(S,null)),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((function(e){e.unregister()}))},30:function(e,t,a){},43:function(e,t,a){},45:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/media/cromadic.6e10cc02.png"},46:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/media/Gameshow.ea2984b4.PNG"},47:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/media/kemono.70d0ccd6.png"},48:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/media/copyright.89d87843.png"},51:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a(111)}},[[51,1,2]]]);
