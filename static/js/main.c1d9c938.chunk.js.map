During this time, I craved fruit candies. After leaving Popeyes a couple weeks ago, Willy and I went to Wal-Mart. I got Sweetarts Jellybeans, but returned them once I found out the self-check didn’t accept cash. That became a mistake when I constantly craved sweets for the next few weeks. A week ago, my sister and I ordered Albanese Sour Bears because I nagged her to get some with me, so I felt less guilty having an accomplice. Today, the package arrived.</p>\r\n                            <p>When we opened the box, there was a lot less than we realized, but then we remembered that two pounds wasn’t a lot to begin with, so we both just opened the package. We arranged the gummi bears to the twelve advertised flavors, but some colors were too close to each other to immediately distinguish. My sister and I spent about fifteen minutes trying to debate if the orange/yellow colors were the same. After a while, we came up with this:</p>\r\n                            \r\n                            <img src={picture} height=\"420px\" width=\"360px\"/> \r\n\r\n                            \r\n                            <p>They were all very good-looking bears, and starting from the top and going right, we tried each flavor.</p>\r\n                            <p>Cherry - Both of us puckered at the taste: It was like cherry cough medicine, but with a huge dose of citric acid. I thought it was okay until the aftertaste. My sister didn’t like this one either.</p>\r\n                            <p>Green apple - My sister couldn’t tell what it was until a few seconds, but I knew immediately because I don’t like green apple flavored candy. However, this one was tolerable. </p>\r\n                            <p>Grape - We knew immediately that this would be the grape by its color, and it’s like eating grape Kool-Aid powder straight from the bag. It wasn’t bad, but it was powerful.</p>\r\n                            <p>Blue raspberry - I love raspberry flavor, but I hate that it’s blue: my least favorite color. This was on par with other blue raspberry flavors, so it was pretty good. My sister wasn’t too happy with this flavor though.</p>\r\n                            <p>Mango - The next one we had no idea how to distinguish it from the last pair of gummi bears appearance-wise, but I thought that these were more skin-colored than the other pair. (Now that I look at the picture, the two bears look different. The right looks more yellow.) Anyways, I got the mango flavor, and I thought it was great, but my sister insisted it was pineapple, so I can’t know for sure.</p>\r\n                            <p>Lime - Wow, it tasted like they peeled the lime and got rid of everything inside. It was so tart and bitter, but it was definitely lime. My sister didn’t like this either.</p>\r\n                            <p>Orange - Like other orange flavored candies, it’s always a solid flavor. These were really good.</p>\r\n                            <p>(At this point, our mouths were getting puckered and dry from all the citric acid killing our teeth, so we got water.)</p>\r\n                            <p>Pink grapefruit - This one was actually really tasty. My sister also liked it, comparing it to the Vitamin-C Halls candies. Real clean bitter taste unlike the lime.</p>\r\n                            <p>Strawberry - this one was one of the best strawberry candies I’ve ever tasted. Very pronounced flavor and didn’t taste medicinal like Twizzlers' strawberry.</p>\r\n                            <p>Watermelon - Normally, both of us dislike watermelon candies, but we agreed that this one was actually really good. No weird flavors that give me headaches.</p>\r\n                            <p>Lemon - holy cow, this one was incredibly sour. We don’t know how else to describe it but “very sour”. Needed to drink a lot of water after that one.</p>\r\n                            <p>Pineapple - I used to love pineapple, but after a certain event that I will not say, I do not like pineapple anymore except on pizza. This tasted like a traumatic experience, so basically the flavor was spot on.</p>\r\n                            <p>After only twelve bears, we couldn’t eat anymore. Maybe it was because neither of us had candy in a long time, so we were more sensitive to the sugar. We felt our sugar highs and we needed to walk around to come back down from being so sugar-hopped. Out of all the flavors, I’d say my favorite was the mango with pink grapefruit, orange, and strawberry following not too far. Cherry, lime, and pineapple, which used to be my favorite flavors, fell all the way to the end of the line. Everything else in the middle were decent. I would probably get these again, but not for a while. They’re definitely high-quality gummies, that’s for sure.</p>\r\n                        \r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </Cell>\r\n\r\n                    <Cell col={4}>\r\n                        <div className = 'sidebar'>\r\n                            <h1>Archive</h1> \r\n                            {articles.map((article) => (\r\n                                <Link to={''.concat(\"food/\",article.id.toString())}>{article.title}</Link>))}                         \r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </Cell>\r\n                </Grid>\r\n\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Food;\r\n","import React, {Component} from 'react';\r\nimport {Tabs, Tab, Grid, Cell, Card, CardTitle, CardText, CardActions, Button, CardMenu, IconButton} from 'react-mdl';\r\nimport bg from '../images/cromadic.png';\r\nimport bg2 from '../images/Gameshow.PNG';\r\nimport bg3 from '../images/kemono.png';\r\nimport bg4 from '../images/copyright.png';\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Projects extends Component{\r\n    constructor(props){\r\n        super(props);\r\n        this.state = {activeTab: 0};\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    toggleCategories(){\r\n        if(this.state.activeTab === 0){\r\n            return(\r\n                <div className='projects-grid'>\r\n                    \r\n\r\n                    <Card shadow={5} style={{minWidth: '450', margin: 'auto'}}>\r\n                        <CardTitle style={{color:'#fff', height: '160px' ,background:`url(${bg})`, backgroundSize:'cover',\r\n                                        backgroundPosition: 'center', borderColor:'black'}} expand>\r\n                            Cromadic\r\n                        </CardTitle>\r\n                        <CardText>Singleplayer adventure game of a crow trying to find their clanmate.

Over the years, my friends would go to In-N-Out and rave about how no other burger compares to the Double-Double. I’ve watched skits overexaggerating their emotions and showing off how delicious the burgers are to them. Popular internet celebrities would fly all the way to Southern California and almost all of them would make a video of them trying (and then annoyingly shouting praises towards the other people eating) the burger. I lived my entire life in Southern California… and I’ve never been to In-N-Out before.</p> \r\n                            <p>I have been curious about this burger throughout my childhood. In school, if a prize was a free burger from In-N-Out, there would be more participants for the event. Raffle prizes always seem to include In-N-Out food. When people get their blood drawn for donation, the choice was either In-N-Out or a gift card (and most of my friends who did donate blood chose In-N-Out). Once, when I was in the school office waiting for a transcript, another student was ditching class. One of the advisors told her to go to class while the girl was being dismissive. After a minute, the advisor bribed her saying “If you go to class, I’ll buy you In-N-Out” (At this point I was shocked. Getting free food for ditching?). I would be lying if I wasn’t envious at that point.</p> \r\n                            <p>Fast forward to college and I’m in my dorm with friends. It’s a few minutes before my 18th birthday, and I’m downstairs with my dormmates. My friend Phillip comes back to the dorm with a present for me. I see in his hands it’s an In-N-Out burger: a Double-Double. I thank him and unwrap it. Wow this looks pretty good. The burger was put together pretty neatly and tightly, unlike other establishes like McDonalds where the bun might be sliding halfway across the burger before I open it. The vegetables were fresh-looking, the burger looked perfect, and the onions and sauce glued the burger together. Eagerly, I took a bite of the burger.</p> \r\n                            <p>It was… decent. I was definitely happy with the burger: the burger was charred nicely, the sauce was savory, and the vegetables were crisp. It was one of the better burgers I’ve had, but I just can’t help but think I’ve been missing out on what everyone else was experiencing. Maybe I don’t like burgers as much as everyone? Maybe my taste buds weren’t sophisticated enough? Maybe the hype was too strong? Regardless, I couldn’t help but think I was lied to or duped. I think to myself maybe I’m being really disrespectful. After hanging out more with my friends and celebrating my birthday with freshman rowdiness, I went to bed around 1AM and reflected on the burger. I wouldn’t say that I crave the burger or even go out of my way to buy it, but I can definitely say that it was a very good burger. Hopefully saying this isn’t sacrilegious and SoCal will hunt me down for an apology.</p> \r\n                         \r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </Cell>\r\n\r\n                    <Cell col={4}>\r\n                        <div className = 'sidebar'>\r\n                            <h1>Archive</h1> \r\n                            {articles.map((article) => (\r\n                                <Link to={article.id.toString()}>{article.title}</Link>))}                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </Cell>\r\n                </Grid>\r\n\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Food;\r\n","import React, {Component} from 'react';\r\nimport {Link} from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport {Grid, Cell} from 'react-mdl';\r\n\r\nimport \"../foodpage.css\";\r\nimport articles from '../foodsidebar';\r\n\r\nclass Food extends Component{\r\n    render() {\r\n        return(\r\n            <div style={{width: '100%', margin: 'auto'}}>\r\n                <Grid className='about-grid'>\r\n                    <Cell col={12}>\r\n                        <div className = 'food-text'>\r\n                            <h1>Foods Blog</h1> \r\n                         \r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </Cell>\r\n\r\n                    <Cell col={8}>\r\n                        <div className = 'food-paragraph'>\r\n                            <h1>My First Time At Popeyes</h1>\r\n                            <h2>Mar. 13, 2020</h2>\r\n                            <p>Before I start my review, I have to say: Wow, what a month this was. I was going to create another review, but recently after, my neighbors had a burglary. It made my mom paranoid, so I had to stay at home for entire days to keep her from going off. A few weeks later, the COVID-19 threat has started making news, and yet again, my mom starts hoarding supplies (sorry Costco shoppers that actually needed toilet paper). After being in my house for over a month, I start getting antsy. I am an introvert, but I guess I do want to go out sometimes after all, COVID-19 pandemic or not.</p>\r\n                            <p>Today, one of my first friends from college, Willy, called me out of the blue asked me to go out to lunch with him, and since my brother was still in the house, I agreed. Willy asked where I wanted to go, and the first thing that I thought of was Popeyes. I have never been there, and many people say the place is awesome, way better than KFC. Willy agreed with my suggestion but warned me that I’d feel like garbage after eating it, even worse than eating a Munchie Meal at Jack in the Box. When we arrived at the place, I asked Willy what’s good here. He recommended the chicken sandwich. He said the first time he had it, it was prepared like ass, but the second time, it was much better. He assured me the place we were going to would not be where he was served ass.</p>\r\n                            <p>He ordered a 2-piece combo and I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich with a side of Cajun fries. Not even a minute later, his order was ready and mine only a few seconds after. Surprised at how fast they were, we got our food and sat down. Looking at my food, I was worried that my food would be cold since we were positive that our food was just sitting in a heater waiting for us. I opened my bag and I looked at my sandwich. The chicken was alarmingly huge. I don’t eat a lot of fast food, so I usually see McDonald’s or Wendy’s flat chicken patty. Popeye’s had a slab of meat in a bun covered in sauce. The sandwich was still warm, and I am not picky when it comes to the temperature of my food. Only if it were cold or frozen, I would say something.</p>\r\n                            <p>The sandwich was really nice even given the fact that the chicken sitting under a heater. While the skin wasn’t crispy, it still had some texture and the meat wasn’t dry. The sauce was pleasantly spicy and kicked almost immediately. The pickles were okay. They weren’t crunchy, and it did have a bit of tang, but it was almost completely drowned out by the sauce. I remember a few months ago when the hype of the new sandwich caused many stores to close in hours, and I look down and wonder again if my taste buds were too unrefined to appreciate the taste. True, my sandwich was not fresh, but even if it were, I probably would feel the exact same about the sandwich.</p>\r\n                            <p>I tried the fries after. They looked rather pale. (I’m sorry I didn’t take pictures of them, or of any of the food. I’m trying to gain confidence to take pictures of my food before eating.) Thankfully, they tasted way better than they looked. Seasoned, spiced fries that were somehow crispy even when lukewarm. Willy asked for their “Blackened Ranch Sauce” and gave me them, so I dipped my fries into them. They tasted even better: even more heat with the usual ranch zest that I like.</p>\r\n                            <p>After we finished, we drove to a Wal-Mart to pick up items, and at that time, I felt slow and groggy. It was a sensation stronger than finishing a Munchie Meal. I felt my stomach gurgle and my head went foggy. I understood at that point and when I went back home, I went to sleep.</p>\r\n                            <p>I do like Popeyes, and even with a pre-made meal, it was still pretty good. I don’t feel like coming back anytime soon, but I would not feel forced to come back immediately… or even later this month. In the meantime, I’ll still be in my house job searching. I’ll also promise to add pictures to my blog in later posts.</p>\r\n\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </Cell>\r\n\r\n                    <Cell col={4}>\r\n                        <div className = 'sidebar'>\r\n                            <h1>Archive</h1> \r\n                            {articles.map((article) => (\r\n                                <Link to={article.id.toString()}>{article.title}</Link>))}                         \r\n                       \r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </Cell>\r\n                </Grid>\r\n\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Food;\r\n","import React, {Component} from 'react';\r\nimport {Link} from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport {Grid, Cell} from 'react-mdl';\r\n\r\nimport \"../foodpage.css\";\r\nimport articles from '../foodsidebar';\r\nimport picture from './food-pics/00003_gummies.png';\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Food extends Component{\r\n    render() {\r\n        return(\r\n            <div style={{width: '100%', margin: 'auto'}}>\r\n                <Grid className='about-grid'>\r\n                    <Cell col={12}>\r\n                        <div className = 'food-text'>\r\n                            <h1>Foods Blog</h1> \r\n                         \r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </Cell>\r\n\r\n                    <Cell col={8}>\r\n                        <div className = 'food-paragraph'>\r\n                            <h1>Albanese Sour Gummies</h1>\r\n                            <h2>Apr. 5, 2020</h2>\r\n                            <p>With this quarantine, there’s much fewer opportunities to go out. During this time, I craved fruit candies. After leaving Popeyes a couple weeks ago, Willy and I went to Wal-Mart. I got Sweetarts Jellybeans, but returned them once I found out the self-check didn’t accept cash. That became a mistake when I constantly craved sweets for the next few weeks. A week ago, my sister and I ordered Albanese Sour Bears because I nagged her to get some with me, so I felt less guilty having an accomplice. Today, the package arrived.</p>\r\n                            <p>When we opened the box, there was a lot less than we realized, but then we remembered that two pounds wasn’t a lot to begin with, so we both just opened the package. We arranged the gummi bears to the twelve advertised flavors, but some colors were too close to each other to immediately distinguish. My sister and I spent about fifteen minutes trying to debate if the orange/yellow colors were the same. After a while, we came up with this:</p>\r\n                            \r\n                            <img src={picture} height=\"420px\" width=\"360px\"/> \r\n\r\n                            \r\n                            <p>They were all very good-looking bears, and starting from the top and going right, we tried each flavor.</p>\r\n                            <p>Cherry - Both of us puckered at the taste: It was like cherry cough medicine, but with a huge dose of citric acid. I thought it was okay until the aftertaste. My sister didn’t like this one either.</p>\r\n                            <p>Green apple - My sister couldn’t tell what it was until a few seconds, but I knew immediately because I don’t like green apple flavored candy. However, this one was tolerable. </p>\r\n                            <p>Grape - We knew immediately that this would be the grape by its color, and it’s like eating grape Kool-Aid powder straight from the bag. It wasn’t bad, but it was powerful.</p>\r\n                            <p>Blue raspberry - I love raspberry flavor, but I hate that it’s blue: my least favorite color. This was on par with other blue raspberry flavors, so it was pretty good. My sister wasn’t too happy with this flavor though.</p>\r\n                            <p>Mango - The next one we had no idea how to distinguish it from the last pair of gummi bears appearance-wise, but I thought that these were more skin-colored than the other pair. (Now that I look at the picture, the two bears look different. The right looks more yellow.) Anyways, I got the mango flavor, and I thought it was great, but my sister insisted it was pineapple, so I can’t know for sure.</p>\r\n                            <p>Lime - Wow, it tasted like they peeled the lime and got rid of everything inside. It was so tart and bitter, but it was definitely lime. My sister didn’t like this either.</p>\r\n                            <p>Orange - Like other orange flavored candies, it’s always a solid flavor. These were really good.</p>\r\n                            <p>(At this point, our mouths were getting puckered and dry from all the citric acid killing our teeth, so we got water.)</p>\r\n                            <p>Pink grapefruit - This one was actually really tasty. My sister also liked it, comparing it to the Vitamin-C Halls candies. Real clean bitter taste unlike the lime.</p>\r\n                            <p>Strawberry - this one was one of the best strawberry candies I’ve ever tasted. Very pronounced flavor and didn’t taste medicinal like Twizzlers' strawberry.</p>\r\n                            <p>Watermelon - Normally, both of us dislike watermelon candies, but we agreed that this one was actually really good. No weird flavors that give me headaches.</p>\r\n                            <p>Lemon - holy cow, this one was incredibly sour. We don’t know how else to describe it but “very sour”. Needed to drink a lot of water after that one.</p>\r\n                            <p>Pineapple - I used to love pineapple, but after a certain event that I will not say, I do not like pineapple anymore except on pizza. This tasted like a traumatic experience, so basically the flavor was spot on.</p>\r\n                            <p>After only twelve bears, we couldn’t eat anymore. Maybe it was because neither of us had candy in a long time, so we were more sensitive to the sugar. We felt our sugar highs and we needed to walk around to come back down from being so sugar-hopped. Out of all the flavors, I’d say my favorite was the mango with pink grapefruit, orange, and strawberry following not too far. Cherry, lime, and pineapple, which used to be my favorite flavors, fell all the way to the end of the line. Everything else in the middle were decent. I would probably get these again, but not for a while. They’re definitely high-quality gummies, that’s for sure.</p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        \r\n                    </Cell>\r\n\r\n                    <Cell col={4}>\r\n                        <div className = 'sidebar'>\r\n                            <h1>Archive</h1> \r\n                            {articles.map((article) => (\r\n                                <Link to={article.id.toString()}>{article.title}</Link>))}                         \r\n                       \r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </Cell>\r\n                </Grid>\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Food;\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\nimport { Switch, Route, HashRouter, Link } from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\n//Main pages\r\nimport LandingPage from './landingpage';\r\nimport AboutMe from './aboutmepage';\r\nimport FoodPage from  './foodpage';\r\nimport Project from './projectspage';\r\n\r\n//Other website pages\r\nimport Osucompare from './projects/osucompare.js';\r\n\r\n\r\n//Food list pages\r\nimport _1 from './food-articles/00001.js';\r\nimport _2 from './food-articles/00002.js';\r\nimport _3 from './food-articles/00003.js';\r\n\r\n\r\nconst Main = () => (\r\n    <HashRouter>\r\n        <Switch>\r\n            <Route exact path='/' component = {LandingPage}/>\r\n            <Route exact path='/aboutme' component = {AboutMe}/>\r\n            <Route exact path='/food' component = {FoodPage}/>\r\n            <Route exact path='/projects' component = {Project}/>\r\n\r\n            {/*Non-header links*/}\r\n            <Route exact path='/osucompare' component = {Osucompare}/>\r\n\r\n            {/*Food-list*/}\r\n            <Route exact path='/food/1' component = {_1}/>\r\n            <Route exact path='/food/2' component = {_2}/>\r\n            <Route exact path='/food/3' component = {_3}/>\r\n\r\n        </Switch>\r\n    </HashRouter>\r\n)\r\n\r\nexport default Main;\r\n","import React, {Component} from 'react';\nimport {Layout, Header, Textfield, Drawer, Navigation, Content} from 'react-mdl';\nimport {HashRouter, Route, Link, Router} from 'react-router-dom';\nimport Main from './components/main';\nimport \"./App.css\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n\n\n    <div className=\"Landing\" style={{height: '100vh',margin: 'auto', position: 'relative', flex: 0}}>\n        <Layout fixedHeader>\n            <Header title=\"Kenneth Yam\">\n                <HashRouter>\n                  <div>        \n                  <Link to=\"/\" className = 'header-text'>Homepage</Link>\n                  <Link to=\"/aboutme\" className = 'header-text'>About Me</Link> \n                  <Link to=\"/projects\" className = 'header-text'>Projects</Link>\n                  <Link to=\"/food\" className = 'header-text'>Foods</Link>           \n                  </div>\n                </HashRouter>\n            </Header>\n\n\n            <Content>\n              <div className='page-content' />\n              <Main/>\n            </Content>\n\n        </Layout>\n    </div>\n  );\n  \n}\n\nexport default App;\n/*npm run deploy to update*/\n/* If I want to make a search bar\n<Textfield\n    value=\"Find Doesn't Work\"\n    onChange={() => {}}\n    label=\"Search\"\n    expandable\n    expandableIcon=\"search\"\n/>\n\n            <Drawer title=\"Links\">\n              <HashRouter>\n                    <Link to=\"/\">Homepage</Link>\n                    <Link to=\"/projects\">Projects</Link>\n                    <Link to=\"/food\">Foods</Link>\n              </HashRouter>\n            </Drawer>\n*/","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
