Not even a minute later, his order was ready and mine only a few seconds after. Surprised at how fast they were, we got our food and sat down. Looking at my food, I was worried that my food would be cold since we were positive that our food was just sitting in a heater waiting for us. I opened my bag and I looked at my sandwich. The chicken was alarmingly huge. I don\u2019t eat a lot of fast food, so I usually see McDonald\u2019s or Wendy\u2019s flat chicken patty. Popeye\u2019s had a slab of meat in a bun covered in sauce.

They weren\u2019t crunchy, and it did have a bit of tang, but it was almost completely drowned out by the sauce. I remember a few months ago when the hype of the new sandwich caused many stores to close in hours, and I look down and wonder again if my taste buds were too unrefined to appreciate the taste. True, my sandwich was not fresh, but even if it were, I probably would feel the exact same about the sandwich."),n.a.createElement("p",null,"I tried the fries after. They looked rather pale.

Thankfully, they tasted way better than they looked. Seasoned, spiced fries that were somehow crispy even when lukewarm.
