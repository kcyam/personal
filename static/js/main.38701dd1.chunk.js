While the skin wasn\u2019t crispy, it still had some texture and the meat wasn\u2019t dry. The sauce was pleasantly spicy and kicked almost immediately. The pickles were okay. They weren\u2019t crunchy, and it did have a bit of tang, but it was almost completely drowned out by the sauce. I remember a few months ago when the hype of the new sandwich caused many stores to close in hours, and I look down and wonder again if my taste buds were too unrefined to appreciate the taste. True, my sandwich was not fresh, but even if it were, I probably would feel the exact same about the sandwich."),r.a.createElement("p",null,"I tried the fries after. They looked rather pale.

Thankfully, they tasted way better than they looked. Seasoned, spiced fries that were somehow crispy even when lukewarm.
